## Overview
Successfully integrated 43 new radiocarbon dates from Public Archaeology Facility (PAF) reports into the bean and maize arrival analysis. The new dataset now includes maize, bean, and squash dates from multiple archaeological sites in New York.

### Dataset Statistics
- **Original dataset**: 114 dates (43 beans, 65 maize, 4 squash, 2 squash excluded)
- **New PAF dates**: 43 dates (3 beans, 39 maize, 1 squash)
- **Combined dataset**: 157 dates (44 beans, 109 maize, 4 squash)

## Updated Analysis Results

### Bayesian Arrival Analysis

#### Sample Sizes
- Bean dates: n = 44 (previously 41)
- Maize dates: n = 109 (previously 65)
- Squash dates: n = 4 (unchanged)

#### SPD Peak Dates
- **Bean SPD peak**: 655 cal BP (AD 1295)
- **Maize SPD peak**: 672 cal BP (AD 1278)

#### Earliest Arrival Estimates

**BEANS:**
- Oldest 5 dates range: 576-915 cal BP
- Calendar range: AD 1035-1374
- Best estimate (median of oldest): 834 cal BP (**AD 1116**)
- Oldest date: Chenango_Point_F383 (920±40 BP)

**MAIZE:**
- Oldest 5 dates range: 723-1053 cal BP
- Calendar range: AD 897-1227
- Best estimate (median of oldest): 954 cal BP (**AD 996**)
- Oldest dates (NEW from PAF):
  1. Broome_Tech_PAF_F46b: 1050±40 BP → 954 cal BP (AD 996)
  2. Broome_Tech_PAF_F15: 990±40 BP → 868 cal BP (AD 1082)
  3. Broome_Tech_PAF_F9: 960±40 BP → 852 cal BP (AD 1098)

#### Key Finding
**Maize appears ~120 years EARLIER than beans** in the archaeological record.

This represents a shift from previous analyses, as the new PAF maize dates from Broome Tech push the earliest maize evidence earlier.

### Three Sisters Comparison

#### Boundary Estimates (95% HDR)

**Beans**: 950-533 cal BP (AD 1417-1000)
**Maize**: 1164-668 cal BP (AD 1282-786)
**Squash**: 7749-516 cal BP (AD 1434 to 5799 BC)

#### Hypothesis Testing

**H1: Squash arrived before both beans and maize**
- P(squash > beans AND squash > maize) = **0.858** (Strong evidence)

**H2: Beans and maize simultaneous (±100 yrs), after squash**
- P(|bean-maize| ≤ 100 AND both < squash) = **0.196** (Weak evidence)

#### Arrival Time Differences

**Squash - Bean**: Mean = 3320 years, Median = 3126 years
**Squash - Maize**: Mean = 3146 years, Median = 2945 years
**Bean - Maize**: Mean = -173 years, Median = -187 years (beans later)

## Impact on Previous Findings

### Changed Results
1. **Earlier maize dates**: The PAF Broome Tech dates (1050±40 BP, 990±40 BP, 960±40 BP) are now the oldest maize dates in the dataset
2. **Larger maize sample**: Increased from 65 to 109 dates (68% increase)
3. **Strengthened bean-maize difference**: Maize now appears ~120 years earlier instead of roughly contemporaneous

### Consistent Results
1. **Squash antiquity**: Still significantly earlier than agricultural crops
2. **General timing**: Maize and beans still cluster in AD 1000-1400 range
3. **Three Sisters non-simultaneity**: Still strong evidence against simultaneous arrival

## Files Updated
- `radiocarbon_dates.csv` - Combined dataset (now 157 dates)
- `arrival_summary.csv` - Updated Bayesian arrival estimates
- `arrival_analysis_results.pdf` - Updated plots (partial, plotting error in final render)
- `paf_dates.csv` - New PAF dates in structured format
- `radiocarbon_dates_backup.csv` - Backup of original dataset

## Quality Control Notes

### Notable Dates
- One bean date from Broome Tech (AA31007) appears in both the original Hart dataset and the PAF dataset - possible duplicate, should verify
- The PAF Broome Tech maize dates significantly expand the early end of the maize distribution
- Several very recent maize dates added (270-300 BP) from Chenango Point South

### Next Steps
1. Check for any duplicate dates between original Hart data and PAF data
2. Investigate the plotting error in bayesian_arrival_final.R (ylim issue)
3. Consider geographic distribution analysis with the new PAF sites
4. Update any publications/reports with new sample sizes and findings

## Conclusion

The integration of PAF dates has **strengthened the evidence for earlier maize arrival** compared to beans, with the oldest reliable maize dates now around **AD 996** (954 cal BP) compared to beans at **AD 1116** (834 cal BP). The substantial increase in maize sample size (65→109) also increases confidence in these estimates.
