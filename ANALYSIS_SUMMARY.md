## Comparison: Beans vs Maize

Based on the Bayesian analysis of the oldest dates:
- **Maize appears slightly earlier (~8 years)**, but this difference is well within error margins
- Both crops show earliest arrival estimates in the **mid-13th century AD (1240s-1250s)**
- The 95% boundary ranges overlap substantially:
  - Beans: 1174-1380 cal AD
  - Maize: 1178-1383 cal AD

## Interpretation

The Bayesian analysis suggests that **beans and maize arrived in the northeastern Eastern Woodlands at approximately the same time**, around the **late 13th century AD**. The 8-year difference between best estimates is not statistically significant given the error ranges.

The SPD peaks (late 13th century) show when these crops were most commonly used/deposited in the archaeological record, which is slightly later than the earliest arrivals, suggesting a period of initial adoption followed by increased use.
