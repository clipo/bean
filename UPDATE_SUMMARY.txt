NEW FILES CREATED:

1. paf_dates.csv - Structured data from PAF_Dates.pdf (43 dates)
2. PAF_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md - Detailed documentation
3. merge_paf_dates.R - Script for combining datasets
4. radiocarbon_dates_backup.csv - Backup of original data
5. UPDATE_SUMMARY.txt - This file

ANALYSES RE-RUN SUCCESSFULLY:

✓ bayesian_arrival_final.R - Bayesian arrival analysis
✓ three_sisters_comparison.R - Three-way hypothesis testing  
✓ run_abc_comparison.R - ABC demographic model comparison
✓ Quarto document rendering - Full PDF report

KEY RESULTS WITH NEW DATA:

1. MAIZE NOW SIGNIFICANTLY EARLIER than previous analyses
   - Oldest dates from Broome Tech PAF: 1050±40, 990±40, 960±40 BP
   - Best estimate: AD 996 (was ~AD 1040-1100 previously)

2. BEAN-MAIZE TEMPORAL GAP confirmed
   - Maize ~120 years earlier than beans
   - Beans: AD 1116 (834 cal BP)
   - Maize: AD 996 (954 cal BP)

3. SQUASH ANTIQUITY unchanged
   - Still 3000+ years before agricultural crops
   - One new Late Prehistoric specimen (AD 1159-1281)

4. SAMPLE SIZE IMPROVEMENTS
   - Maize +68% increase (65→109 dates)
   - Strengthens statistical confidence in estimates
   - Reduces uncertainty in boundary estimates

NEXT STEPS (if needed):

□ Check for potential duplicates between Hart & PAF datasets
□ Geographic analysis with new PAF site locations
□ Update any manuscripts/presentations with new sample sizes
□ Consider sensitivity analysis excluding/including PAF dates
